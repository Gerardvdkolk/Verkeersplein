Application
==============

By changing the title to ``Application`` the title gets changed from ``Devices`` to ``Application``


How are the folders structured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The script searches for all the devices present in the program. 
*(In this case just ONE)*

A ``FolderInfo`` file can be added in the device folder to change the devices page. 

a folder named **Devices** is automattically added, and is based on all the devices present in the current device:

.. image:: /_Images/DevicesDevices.png

all other objects are added as described in: :ref:`Pou's <Pous>`



.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

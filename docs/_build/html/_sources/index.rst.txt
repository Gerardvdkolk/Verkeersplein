CODESYS EXPORT SAMPLE PROJECT
=========================================
An easy to use CODESYS to sphinx file structure. 

**All** text in these pages is written with the reStructuredText format. 

You can highlight text in *italics* or, to provide even more emphasis
in **bold**. Often, when describing computer code, we like to use a
``fixed space font`` to quote code snippets.

See more on `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_.

How is this page generated? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. image:: /_Images/CreateHomepage.png

A text file named: ``ProjectInfo`` is parsed and pasted into the homepage (this page) of the project.

What is also generated by the script?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The script will loop trough **all** objects in the ``CODESYS`` project. Only the following objects will get parsed:

- POU's

  - FUNCTION
  - PROGRAM

- STRUCTS

  - ENUM
  - STRUCT


The ``index`` is divided into two parts:

- POUs
- Devices

.. figure:: /_Images/POUs_Devices.png

   The division is in direct correlation to where the programmers saves the objects. 

When the user saves a POU in the ``Devices`` page, the POU can **only** be found in the Devices index.
